# Fed Text
This repository contains (I hope) useful text data from the Federal Reserve. For people interested in text analysis, I have scraped the transcripts together with the appendices from 1969 - 2007. There is no guarantee that everything is perfect but it will be a good starting point for your text analysis projects.


## FOMC Transcripts
The compressed file `transcripts_6907.csv.zip` contains FOMC discussions from 1969 - 2007. The transcripts were only scraped until 2007 since I did not require a longer time period for my project. However, the more recent transcripts are much easier to scrape, so this should still be helpful.
