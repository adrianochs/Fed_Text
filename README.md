# Fed Text
This repository contains (I hope) useful text data from the Federal Reserve. For people interested in text analysis, I have scraped the transcripts together with the appendices from 1969 - 2007. There is no guarantee that everything is perfect but it will be a good starting point for your text analysis projects.
